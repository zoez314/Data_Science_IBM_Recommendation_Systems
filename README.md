# Recommendation System Project

This project is a recommendation system that suggests articles to users based on their interactions with other articles. It uses matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate recommendations.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries to run:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (optional, for running Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter


### Installation

Step-by-step explanation of how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zoez314/Data_Science_IBM_Recommendation_Systems.git
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:

cd recommendation-system

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Break Down Tests
Test 1: Test Content-Based Recommendations

This test checks if the content-based recommendation system returns articles that are similar based on article titles and content.
Why? This ensures that the recommender system works as expected for users based on article similarities.
Test 2: Test Matrix Factorization Recommendations

This test checks the SVD-based recommendation system, ensuring that it returns articles based on latent feature similarities.
Why? This verifies that the matrix factorization algorithm is implemented and functions correctly.
Project Instructions
In this project, the goal is to implement a recommendation system that suggests articles to users based on the following:

Content-based Filtering: This uses the article content (such as titles or text) to recommend similar articles.
Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization): This method uses user-item interaction data to suggest articles that are popular among similar users.
Steps:

Data Preparation: Process the user-item interaction matrix.
Content-Based Filtering: Use TF-IDF and cosine similarity to generate recommendations based on article titles.
Matrix Factorization (SVD): Apply Singular Value Decomposition to factorize the user-item interaction matrix and generate recommendations.
Evaluation: Evaluate the recommendation system by comparing the predicted articles against the actual user interactions (using metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy).
Results: Provide a list of recommended articles for a given user based on content or collaborative filtering.
